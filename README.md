# Installation
## Requires the latest Terraform and Ansible
Azure Cloudshell has both Terraform and Ansible preinstalled, so cloning and launching from Cloudshell is convienent.
## Installation in your local Linux environment 
Cloudshell in the Portal times out after 20 minutes, so installing in your local environment or Linux VM is a good option.  If you use Cloudshell, you will have to hit the keyboard every now and then to prevent a timeout.
